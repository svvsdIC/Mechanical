# Poseidon Project: Mechanical Subsystem

## Description
This repository contains the design documentation and CAD files for the project's mechanical components/design. It also includes an archive of those files.

> **Note:** Individual files can only be worked on one at a time because there isn't an easy way to merge changes in CAD files, as would normally happen in code. Since SolidWorks has individual files for components, the workload can be broken up so that collaborators can work on separate components. With Fusion 360, since the overall file is an assembly, there is no easy way for multiple collaborators to work simultaneously on the design.

### Team Objectives
